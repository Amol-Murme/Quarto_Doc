Model_Details:
  details: "Detailed Information regarding model."

Data_Preparation: "The dataset is randomly split into train, validation and holdout test datasets. Train data is used for model fitting. Validation dataset is used for model tuning i.e. finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters that provide the best fit on a given dataset. Holdout test dataset is used to arrive at an unbiased estimate of OOS performance of the model."

Feature_Transformation: "Typically all features are converted into numeric features. This is a mandatory transformation for many algorithms such as XGBoost."

Model_Tunning: "Various models are fitted to the train dataset with multiple combination of hyperparameters (HP). These HP typically control model capacity (large capacity models will provide better fit on train data but may fail to generalize to OOS dataset), model complexity (typically models with larger capacity are also more complex) and model generalization (to prevent overfitting to train data)."

Model_Perfor_Eval: "Performance of trained models is compared on validation dataset using different statistics. Final HP combination and the resultant final model is selected on basis of performance on the validation dataset."

Model_Stability: "Model stability is checked by detecting drift/shift in features between train, validation and test dataset. This is done by computing Stability Index at model and individual feature level to identify if model is stable or not."
